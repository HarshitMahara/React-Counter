# React Counter Application

This is a simple React application that demonstrates the use of React hooks, specifically `useState`, to manage state in a functional component. The application features two buttons: "Add Value" and "Remove Value". These buttons allow the user to increment or decrement a counter value, with constraints ensuring the counter stays between 0 and 20.

## Project Overview

This project is a basic example of a React application using functional components and hooks. It helps to understand how state management is done in modern React applications using `useState`.

### Features

- Increment the counter by 1 using the "Add Value" button.
- Decrement the counter by 1 using the "Remove Value" button.
- The counter value is constrained between 0 and 20.
